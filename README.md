# ***io_scene_gzrs2***

GunZ: The Duel RealSpace2/3 content importer for Blender 4.2.x LTS.<br>
Intended for users wishing to visualize and modify GunZ content or prepare the data for a modern game engine.

Please report bugs and unimplemented features to: ***Krunk#6051***

RaGEZONE thread: ***https://forum.ragezone.com/f496/io_scene_gzrs2-blender-3-1-map-1204327/***

## ***Make sure you specify a working directory in addon preferences.â€‹***
***Don't update Blender's major version. This plugin will only support the v4.2 branch until further notice.***

# Latest Update

[***ONLY WORKS WITH BLENDER 4.2.x!! >> DOWNLOAD v0.9.7***](https://github.com/Krunklehorn/io-scene-gzrs2/releases/tag/v0.9.7)

* NEW: "Pre-process Geometry" operator!
  * Available on World, Navigation and Collision meshes
  * Dissolves degenerate and co-linear vertices, deletes loose pieces then splits non-planar and concave faces
  * Useful for overcoming geometry errors during map export
* NEW: Server profile for Duelists!
  * Light properties: Range, Shadow Bias, Shadow Resolution
  * Material properties: Specular Power (IOR Level), Normal/Specular/Emissive texture paths, Height Offset
  * .rs.xml LIGHT tags: DIRECTION, RANGE, INNERCONE, OUTERCONE, SHADOWBIAS, SHADOWRES
  * .rs.xml MATERIAL tags: POWER, SPECULARINTENSITY, EMISSIVEINTENSITY, HEIGHTOFFSET, NORMALMAP, SPECULARMAP, EMISSIVEMAP
* Armature modifiers no longer enable volume preservation upon import
* Valid bone and bone root prefixes now include "obj_" variants
* RobinNorling: Fixed GunZ 2 texture loading
* Overhauled project folder structure
* Other minor fixes

# Import Features

* Fully supported filetypes: .rs, .elu, .ani, .col, .cl2, .nav, .lm
* Partially supported filetypes: .scene.xml, .prop.xml

<!-- -->

* Displays world geometry, collision and navigation data using mesh objects
* Displays bsptree and octree bounding boxes, occlusion planes, sounds, spawns, powerups and other dummies using empties
* Approximates fog using a volume scatter or volume absorption shader
* Reinterprets light data to be useful in Blender
* Displays lightmaps using a linked node group for quick toggling

### Known Issues

* GunZ 1: handful of .elus with improper bone weights (woman-parts_eola)
* GunZ 1: some elus with reversed winding-order/flipped normals (woman-parts27, woman-parts_sum08, woman-parts_santa, etc.)
* GunZ 1: some maps with a ton of skipped dummies (Halloween Town)

<!-- -->

* GunZ 2: some objects are not oriented correctly (spotlights)
* GunZ 2: embedded scene hierarchies are not parsed yet (lighting_candlestick_y02, lighting_chandelier_g01, etc.)
* GunZ 2: materials do not support composition layers yet (weird colored terrain)


# Export Features

## Map Export (.rs) (Beta!) - [Mapping Guide](https://github.com/Krunklehorn/io-scene-gzrs2/wiki)

* Writes .rs, .bsp, .col, .lm and .xml data all at once
* Exports empties, meshes, lights and cameras
* Requires at least one world mesh
* Requires at least one collision mesh or a world mesh with the 'Collision' switch enabled
  * Collision geometry should form a closed surface with no overlaps, holes or concave polygons
  * Collision geometry should should appear red when viewed from out of bounds through the 'Face Orientation' overlay
* Ignores anything not marked by the type system...
  * Empty: Spawn, Flare, Sound, Smoke, Item, Occlusion
  * Mesh: World, Collision, Navigation
  * Light: Static, Dynamic
  * Camera: Wait, Track

### Untested Features

* Spawn empties for quest mobs
* Occlusion planes for props
* Camera empties

### Known Issues

## Model Export (.elu)

* GunZ 1 version 0x5007
* Supports both static and skinned meshes
* Automatically triangulates quads and ngons

<!-- -->

* Exports smooth normals if custom split normals are included
* Exports bone weight data from vertex groups
* Exports UV data from UV channel 0
* Exports cloth physics data from color attribute channel 0

<!-- -->

* Requires mesh objects be of type 'Prop'
* Requires empties be of type 'Attachment'
* Requires valid materials in each slot, if present (see below)
* Requires bones be contained in an Armature object
* Requires Armatures be linked using an Armature modifier (not parented!)
* Requires vertex groups corresponding to bones by exact name (case-sensitive!)
* Requires unique names for all bones across all linked armatures

### Material Parameters & Presets

Materials have changed! No more node wrangling, it's all handled by presets! =)

The plugin adds a custom "Realspace" panel in the Material Properties view. (see above) The panel provides a live report on what data will be written if exported. To modify the overall look of a material, use the "Change Preset" button.

Some parameters can be configured for special behavior:

| Parameter | Controlled By | Details |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Texture / Alpha Path | Override Texpath / Write Directory ||
| Twosided | Material Properties -> Viewport Display -> Backface Culling ||
| Additive | Change Preset -> Additive ||
| Alphatest | Change Preset -> Tested | Configure the Threshold value of the Math: Greater Than node |
| Use Opacity | Change Preset -> Blended | Must have a valid texture in the Image Texture node |
| Is Animated | File name of the connected texture ||
| Frame Count / Frame Speed / Frame Gap | File name of the connected texture ||


## Navmesh Export (.nav)

* Automatically triangulates quads and ngons
  * For best results, user should do so manually
* Selected mesh must be manifold


## Lightmap Export (.lm)

* overwrite only
* supports image data as well as UVs
  * requires a GunZ 1 .rs file for the same map in the same directory
  * UV export requires an active mesh object with valid UVs in channel 2
* includes experimental "version 4" for bugfixes and DXT1 support (thanks to DeffJay)
  * version 4 lightmaps take less space and load faster, resolutions up to 8k are now viable
  * for private servers only, v4 lightmaps do not work with vanilla GunZ
  * contact Krunk#6051 for information on how to implement this


# Planned Features (Long Term)

* GunZ 1: alpha .elu versions: 0x11, 0x5001, 0x5002 and 0x5003
* GunZ 1: lightmap export UV generation

<!-- -->

* GunZ 2: .env.xml support
* GunZ 2: embedded scene hierarchies (ex: props with attached lights)
* GunZ 2: texture composition layers (terrain)
